# Bullets to produce the vision statement

## Objective
Comparison of features Rust and C++ as a systems programming language and try to provide which language will be suitable for which usecase.
* Comparison
  * Performance of systems programming language
      * Look at the specific features that each language has to offer and compare their influence on the performance numbers.
      * Will try to write programs with features missing(or present) and check how the time and other metrics behave.
      * Can find micro benchmaarks and try to verify our results.
  * Memory safety/management in C++ vs. Rust
      * Try to find the answer of how each language provides(or fails to provide) Memory Safety and the cost involved.
      * Write some unsafe codes and then check for memory leaks.
  * Concurrency in C++ vs. Rust
 	  * Rust claims to provide strong support for concurrency. Try to find out how Rust is able to do it and how much better(or worse) its claim is as compared the concurrency support in C++.
 	  * Will write multi threaded programs and measure certain meterics for performance.
 	  * Will also check data races and other memory issues by testing more concurrent programs.

## Motivation
* Try to answer as to why Rust is gaining popularity as systems programming language
* How does Rust compare with very matured languages like C/C++
* Memory safety and Concurrency claims made by Rust
